the arch repos have packages called glfw-x11 and glad
learnOpenGL tutorial says to install glfw and glad manually
I just used glfw from the arch repo, but I installed glad manually because the
arch repo glad package didn't work with learnOpenGL instructions

https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window
section "OpenGL library on Linux"
says 
" For Linux users compiling with GCC, the following command line options may
help you compile the project: -lglfw3 -lGL -lX11 -lpthread -lXrandr -lXi -ldl.
Not correctly linking the corresponding libraries will generate many undefined
reference errors. "

I added those linker flags to my makefile, but I had an error about -lglfw3 not
being found, so I changed it to -lglfw and that seems to work (for now...)

also, apparently the include order for glad and glfw matters ?
